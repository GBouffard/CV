# Guillaume Bouffard
#### A coding MacGyver

I'm a French London-based coding enthusiast, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and likes challenges that involves deep thinking (headaches excluded if possible). Despite having received multiple awards in a previous career, I felt for a long-time that I wasn't my true-self. I was lucky enough to discover Makers Academy at the end of 2014 and took this opportunity to join and do what I wanted to do for a very long time: learn to code. Having graduated from their intense training in June 2015, I am now looking to join long-term a business that I can add value to, at the same time as I can keep on learning new skills from its senior techical team.
