# Guillaume Bouffard

A French London-based coding MacGyver, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and likes challenges that involves deep thinking (headaches excluded if possible). Despite having earnt multiple awards in a previous life, I wasn't happy anymore with this career and decided to join Makers Academy to do what I wanted to do for a long time; learn to code. Having graduated from their intense training in June 2015, I am now looking to join long-term a business that I can add value to, at the same time as I can keep on learning new skills from its senior techical team.
