## Guillaume Bouffard

A French and fun London-based coding MacGyver, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and challenges that involve a deep level of concentration. Despite having received multiple awards, I felt for a long-time that I wasn't true to myself in my previous career. In March 2015, I took a leap of faith and put my trust in the Makers Academy cursus to do what I wanted to do for a very long time: learn how to code. 

Having recently graduated, I am now looking to join for the long-term a business that I can add value to and learn from, at the same time as I can enjoy my new career with a team of smart and fun people.

### Additional Skills:

- **Agile methodology**: I follow its principle and start by building a MVP for every project. I then apply the same for additional features; They are only added one-step-at-a-time.
- **TDD addiction**: I do not write single line of code before I have written in English the behaviors that I expect my classes to have (or not to have). Once I'm happy with how I want the MVP to behave, I start coding.
- **Proactive and Autonomous learning**: While I don't have a job (and also when I will have one), I want to keep learning. A the moment, I'm focussed on cementing my knowledge around Javascript and Ruby. Once I will feel that  I have gone as far as I can go on these 2 on my own, I am planning to learn other languages such as Java, Swift and Python.
- **Teamwork and Pair-programming**: I find it pretty easy to get along with my peers and the software development community. I especially like solving problems as a team or while pair-programming because it's a great feeling to share; and also the occasion to high-five everyone in the team because 'we did it'.
- **Debugging & Problem solving**: I have learnt how to use some tricks to solve issues as well as enhance my Google search skills to find relevant solutions to the problems that I faced.
- ** Meeting deadlines and work under pressure**: I was already doing in my previous jobs. I'm still doing it when it comes to a coding challenge. We had some at Makers Academy every week; I never missed a single submission deadline.
- **Clean and effective code**: I often refactor my code, work on indentation and follow the DRY and YAGNI rules. In the future, I know that it will also make it easier for other developers who will be working with me to receive clean code; also probably better for my own reputation.
- **Creativity**: I'm bringing loads of design, artistic and clients-focused ideas to a project. The final team project that I worked on, at makers Academy was actually one of my ideas that I pitched. I'm also the lead singer in a rock band, which has nothing to do with coding, but I'm the main songwriter; my audio-creativity may not be that bad on that side either as we managed to get a semi-partnership with Universal Music and release some songs with them.
- **Fun and good sence of humour**: According to what people say about me, I have some. I think that it's very important and it's so much easier to work with someone who's fun and entertaining; not as important as smart and efficient but it's a great bonus.

### Languages skills:

My Github CV is essentially focused on my future career and I don't want to deviate from this. My previous achievements include growing a network of 330% and being twice sales executive of the year, but these are now actually irrelevant given the fact that I am completely changing job.
