## Guillaume Bouffard

A French and fun London-based coding MacGyver, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and challenges that involve a deep level of concentration. Despite having received multiple awards, I felt for a long-time that I wasn't true to myself in my previous career. In March 2015, I took a leap of faith and put my trust in the Makers Academy cursus to do what I wanted to do for a very long time: learn how to code. 

Having recently graduated, I am now looking to join for the long-term a business that I can add value to and learn from, at the same time as I can enjoy my new career with a team of smart and fun people.
