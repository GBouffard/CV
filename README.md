# Guillaume Bouffard
#### A coding MacGyver

I'm a French London-based coding enthusiast, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and likes challenges that involves deep thinking (headaches excluded if possible). Despite having received multiple awards in the past 10 years, I felt for a long-time that I wasn't my true-self. I was lucky enough to discover Makers Academy at the end of 2014 and took this opportunity to join and do what I wanted to do for a very long time: learn to code. Having graduated from their intense training in June 2015, I am now looking to join for the long-term a business that I can add value to, at the same time as I can keep on learning new skills from its senior techical team.

## Additional information:

My Github CV is essentially focused on my future career and I wouldn't want to deviate from this. As a result, mentionning that my previous achievements include growing a network of 330% or being 2 years-in-a-row top salesperson of the year in a previous company, become very quickly irrelevant. It still plays in my favour to mention it but there is no need to go into depth. My full career history, as well as proofs of results and recommendations from ex-clients and business contacts are available on my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gbouffard) profile.
